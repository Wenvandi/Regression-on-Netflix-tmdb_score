This repository contains the portofolio project assigned by Dibimbing Bootcamp.
#Introduction

This project is a self made machine learning project. The dataset is called Netflix TV Shows and Movies that I download from kaggle.com. The downloaded dataset is saved in a csv file named 'titles'.

This data set was created to list all shows available on Netflix streaming, and analyze the data to find interesting facts. This data was acquired in May 2022 containing data available in the United States. This dataset contains +5k unique titles on Netflix with 15 columns containing their information, including:
